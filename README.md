# Simple-ATM-Simulation-System
- This project implements a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation using 8086 assembly language under DOS.
- The system requires a valid four-digit password before allowing access to banking functions. After successful login, the user can check their balance, deposit money, or withdraw money. The program supports multi-digit numeric input for both deposits and withdrawals, making the system more realistic than single-digit versions.
- The project demonstrates the use of interrupts, buffered input, numeric conversion, and modular procedures such as number printing and input parsing.
